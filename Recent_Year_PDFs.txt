For 2022-2025 papers :

1️⃣ What Actually Depends on PDFs?

Your KG structure depends on:

Paper → Entity edges (triplets)

Predicate types

Entity normalization

Those come from:

PDF → Grobid → Stanza → Triplet extraction

If you skip that for 2022–2025 papers:

They will have citation info

They will have OpenAlex metadata

But they will have no structural triples

That breaks structural novelty modeling.

So yes — new papers must go through extraction.

2️⃣ What Depends on OpenAlex?

OpenAlex gives you:

publication_year

cited_by_count

referenced_works

abstract

This is independent of triplet extraction.

You can absolutely:

Run OpenAlex query only for 2022–2025

Save as openalex_metadata_2022_2025.csv

Merge with old metadata

Concatenate

No need to requery old papers.

3️⃣ Correct Scalable Workflow

When adding new years:

Step A — Process PDFs

Only for new papers:

PDF → Grobid → Stanza → Triplets

Generate:

new triplet CSVs

Step B — Update entity_nodes

Two options:

Option 1 (Correct):

Load old entity_nodes.csv

Extract new entities

Add only unseen ones

Keep existing IDs stable

Option 2 (Dangerous):

Rebuild entire entity_nodes

This will change entity IDs

Break old edges

So you must append, not rebuild.

Step C — Build new knowledge_edges only for new papers

Append to existing CSV.

Step D — Run OpenAlex only for new papers

You can create a separate notebook:

openalex_integration_2022_2025.ipynb

Query only those titles.

Then:

pd.concat([old_metadata, new_metadata])

Perfectly valid.

4️⃣ Should You Re-run Today’s 2628 Query?

No.

That would:

Waste API quota

Risk new rate limit

Possibly produce slightly different similarity matches

You already have metadata for old papers.

Keep it frozen.

5️⃣ What Will Need Rebuilding?

After adding 2022–2025 papers:

You must rebuild:

paper_nodes.csv

citation_edges.csv (because citations now include newer papers)

knowledge_edges.csv (append new ones)

But you do not need to re-extract triplets for old papers.

6️⃣ Very Important — ID Stability

Your global ID format:

{SPLIT}_{DOMAIN}_{local_id}

If you add 2022–2025, make sure:

local_id numbering does not collide

split naming is consistent

domain naming matches

Otherwise temporal modeling will break.

7️⃣ Recommended Clean Strategy

Instead of mixing everything manually:

Create:

data/
  core_2021/
  extension_2025/

Then build:

kg_builder.ipynb

That always:

Reads all triplet folders

Reads all metadata files

Constructs final unified KG

That way your KG is reproducible.

8️⃣ Best Practice for Research

For novelty research, it is actually good to:

Train KG on ≤2021

Evaluate novelty on 2022–2025

So separation is beneficial.

Final Answer

Yes:

• New papers must go through PDF → triplet extraction
• You can run OpenAlex separately
• You should not rerun old OpenAlex queries
• Append, don’t rebuild IDs
• Reconstruct final KG after merging
